/*
See 1.png.
We want to have our domain model at the center of our application.
We would want to model our objects after their real world counterparts.

In 1.png
Circle in the middle, is the domain layer where the objects live, the entities, the value objects,
the aggregates and the factories. The things that are all about how we structure the core
business logic if our App. It should have no dependence on what database we pick or an incoming request.
The purpose of the arrows is the way these things are imported.
As we can see everything flows out from the center nothing comes in.
